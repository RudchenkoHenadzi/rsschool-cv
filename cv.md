## Code examples and completed assignments

I love Fibonacci numbers in general, but I must admit I love some more than others.

I would like for you to write me a function that when given a number (n) returns the n-th number in the Fibonacci Sequence.

```
function nthFibo(n) {
  
  if(n === 0) {
    return 0;
  }
  
  let a = 0;
  let b = 1;
  let c = a + b;
  let d;
  
  for(let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      d = a;
      c = a + b;
      a = b;
      b = c;
  }
  
  return d;
  
}
```
